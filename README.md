## Problem Statement

Today students need help finding jobs and internships related to their Major while in college or upon graduating. 
We aim to create a platform specifically to help Kent State students find, apply for, and obtain these. The platform 
will ideally host posts from Faculty/Staff and related institutions regarding opportunities for things from a 
possible capstone project or something similar to for a job or internship. The customer for this product is Kent State 
Career Services, the users would consist of faculty, university staff, and students. The stakeholder is the executive 
director of career services. Users of the application may not have technical experience, the ideal interface would be 
similar to Handshake or other job boards. The system would be a web application, ideally, the application would be 
hosted on a Linux server.
